The time complexity can be improved by sorting the array. Then the result is the maximum of the following:

1.The product of maximum and second maximum integer in the array (i.e., the last two elements in a sorted array).
2.The product of minimum and second minimum integers in the array (i.e., the first two elements in the sorted array).

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n.log(n))

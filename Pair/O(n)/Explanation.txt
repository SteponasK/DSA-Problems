3. Using Hashing
We can use a hash table to solve this problem in linear time. The idea is to insert each array element nums[i] into a map. We also check if difference (nums[i], target - nums[i]) already exists in the map or not. If the difference is seen before, print the pair and return.

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n) and requires O(n) extra space.
